# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Engineering Log Intelligence System

## üåê Production Access

### Option 1: Production URL (Recommended)
**Main Application:** https://engineering-log-intelligence.vercel.app  
*This stable URL automatically updates to the latest deployment*

**Public Health Check:** https://engineering-log-intelligence.vercel.app/api/health_public

### Option 2: Local Development
The frontend should be running on `http://localhost:3001/`

If it's not running, open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd engineering_log_intelligence/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Your Browser
Go to: `http://localhost:3001/` (local) or the production URL above

### Step 3: Login
You should see a beautiful login page with demo credentials:

**Demo Credentials:**
- **Admin:** `admin` / `password123`
- **Analyst:** `analyst` / `password123`  
- **User:** `user` / `password123`

### Step 4: Explore the Dashboard
Once logged in, you'll see:
- **System Status Cards** at the top
- **Interactive Charts** showing log analytics
- **Real-time Data** that updates when you click "Refresh"

## üéØ What You Should See

### Dashboard Features:
1. **4 Status Cards** showing system health, logs processed, alerts, and response time
2. **Log Volume Chart** - Line chart showing logs over time
3. **Log Distribution Chart** - Pie chart showing log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, etc.)
4. **Response Time Chart** - Line chart showing system performance
5. **Error Types Chart** - Bar chart showing different error categories

### Interactive Features:
- **Hover over charts** to see detailed information
- **Click "Refresh"** to update all data
- **Responsive design** - works on mobile and desktop

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Production Access Issues
- **Authentication Required**: The production URL may require Vercel authentication
- **Solution**: Use the public health check endpoint: `/api/health_public`
- **Alternative**: Access via Vercel dashboard with proper authentication

### If you see a blue-to-purple loading screen:
1. **Wait a moment** - the app is initializing (10-30 seconds)
2. **Check the browser console** (F12) for any error messages
3. **Refresh the page** if it gets stuck
4. **Try the public health check** to verify API connectivity

### If login doesn't work:
1. **Make sure you're using the correct credentials** (case-sensitive)
2. **Check the browser console** for error messages
3. **Try refreshing the page**
4. **Verify API endpoints are responding**

### If charts don't appear:
1. **Wait for the page to fully load**
2. **Click the "Refresh" button** to load data
3. **Check the browser console** for any errors
4. **Charts will show mock data if API is unavailable**

### Known Issues (Day 24 Test Results)
- **Incident Response**: Some escalation rules not functioning properly (66.7% success rate)
- **Incident Creation**: Validation errors in incident creation process
- **Escalation Actions**: Limited escalation action execution

### For More Help
- **Check TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md** for comprehensive troubleshooting
- **Review test results** in `day24_standalone_test_results.json`
- **Check Vercel logs** for production issues

## üöÄ Next Steps

If everything is working, you can:
1. **Try different user roles** (admin, analyst, user) to see different features
2. **Explore the charts** by hovering and interacting with them
3. **Check out other pages** using the navigation menu
4. **Continue to Day 22** for more advanced features
