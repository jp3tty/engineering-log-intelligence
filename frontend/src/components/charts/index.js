/**
 * Charts Index
 * ===========
 * 
 * This file exports all chart components for easy importing.
 * 
 * For beginners: This is a common pattern in JavaScript/Node.js.
 * Instead of importing each component separately, you can import them all from here.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * import { LineChart, BarChart, PieChart } from '@/components/charts'
