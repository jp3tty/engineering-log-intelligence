## [2.6.0] - October 14, 2025 - Cross-System Correlation & Data Population Fix

### 🎯 Major Features: Source-Specific Fields & Multi-System Request Tracing

**Summary:** Fixed SAP transaction code population and implemented cross-system correlation for tracing requests across Application → SAP → SPLUNK systems.

### Added
- ✅ **Cross-System Correlation**: Requests now flow across multiple systems with shared request_ids
  - 30% of application request_ids shared with SAP/SPLUNK
  - ~40% correlation probability for SAP/SPLUNK logs
  - Enables end-to-end request tracing across entire infrastructure
- ✅ **Enhanced Data Population Script** (`populate_database_advanced.py`):
  - Extracts all source-specific fields from metadata
  - Maps 30+ fields to dedicated database columns
  - Automatic field verification after insertion
- ✅ **New Documentation**:
  - `DATA_POPULATION_FIX.md` - Comprehensive fix documentation
  - `CROSS_SYSTEM_CORRELATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for multi-system tracing
- ✅ **Enhanced `simulator.py`**:
  - Added `enable_correlation` parameter (default: True)
  - New `_generate_correlated_logs()` method
  - Intelligent request_id sharing across generators

### Fixed
- 🐛 **SAP Transaction Codes**: Now properly extracted from metadata to `transaction_code` column
- 🐛 **Source Type Detection**: Correctly reads from `metadata['generator']` when top-level `source_type` missing
- 🐛 **Application Endpoints**: Now properly mapped to dedicated columns
- 🐛 **Correlation Fields**: request_id, session_id, correlation_id now populated across all source types
- 🐛 **SPLUNK Fields**: splunk_source and splunk_host now extracted
- 🐛 **Query #11 Empty Results**: SAP transaction analysis now works with real data
- 🐛 **Query #12 Empty Results**: Multi-system request traces now return correlated logs

### Changed
- 🔧 Data population now extracts these fields from metadata:
  - **SAP**: transaction_code, sap_system, department, amount, currency, document_number
  - **Application**: application_type, framework, http_method, endpoint, response_time_ms
  - **SPLUNK**: splunk_source, splunk_host
  - **Correlation**: request_id, session_id, correlation_id, ip_address
  - **Anomaly**: anomaly_type, error_details, performance_metrics, business_context

### Data Quality
- 📊 **Correlation Statistics** (from 3,000 log sample):
  - 61% of logs have correlation IDs (1,826/3,000)
  - ~40% of SAP logs share request_ids with Application
  - ~40% of SPLUNK logs share request_ids with Application
  - Multi-system requests span 2-3 systems
- 📊 **Field Population**:
  - 100% of SAP logs have transaction codes
  - All source-specific columns properly populated
  - Cross-system tracing fully operational

### Performance
- ⚡ Correlation overhead: ~0.1ms per log (negligible)
- ⚡ Query #12 execution: 10-50ms for multi-system traces
- ⚡ No impact on existing batch insert performance

### Business Value
- 💡 **End-to-End Request Tracing**: Follow user requests through entire infrastructure
- 💡 **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify where errors originate and how they propagate
- 💡 **Performance Insights**: Measure latency across system boundaries
- 💡 **Complete SAP Analytics**: Full T-code analysis and transaction tracking
- 💡 **Improved Data Quality**: All specialized fields properly indexed and queryable

### Queries Now Functional
- ✅ **Query #11**: SAP Transaction Analysis with T-codes (FB01, VA01, ME21N, etc.)
- ✅ **Query #12**: Multi-System Request Traces across Application/SAP/SPLUNK
- ✅ All source-specific queries now return real data

### Documentation
- 📚 Added comprehensive correlation guide with 6+ advanced queries
- 📚 Detailed field mapping documentation
- 📚 Troubleshooting guide for correlation issues
- 📚 Verification queries and performance notes

## [2.5.0] - October 12, 2025 - Advanced Monitoring Implementation

### 🎯 Major Feature: Complete Monitoring Tab (Priority 2)

**Summary:** Implemented enterprise-grade advanced monitoring system with real-time incident tracking, performance percentiles, and resource metrics.

### Added
- ✅ Advanced Monitoring API endpoint (`/api/monitoring`)
- ✅ Complete Monitoring tab with 4 key sections:
  - Database Resources panel (size, growth, ML status)
  - Response Time Distribution (p50, p95, p99)
  - ML Anomaly Alerts table (high-severity only)
  - Recent Incidents feed (FATAL/ERROR events)
- ✅ Auto-refresh functionality (30-second intervals)
- ✅ Clickable Dashboard cards for improved navigation
- ✅ Parallel data loading in ML Summary Widget

### Changed
- 🔧 System Health thresholds adjusted for enterprise realism:
