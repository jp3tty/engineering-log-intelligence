# GitHub Actions Workflows

## Current Status: DISABLED

The CI/CD pipeline has been temporarily disabled during development phase.

### Workflows

- `ci-cd.yml.disabled` - Main CI/CD pipeline (disabled)
- `pr-checks.yml` - Pull request quality checks (active)

### Re-enabling CI/CD Pipeline

**TODO: Re-enable after Phase 2 completion**

To re-enable the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Rename `ci-cd.yml.disabled` back to `ci-cd.yml`
2. Fix the test structure issues:
   - Move test files from root to `tests/` directory
   - Update test imports and structure
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly configured
3. Test the pipeline with a small commit

### Issues to Fix Before Re-enabling

1. **Test Structure**: Tests are currently in root directory (`test_*.py`) but CI expects them in `tests/` directory
2. **Test Dependencies**: Ensure all test dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
3. **Import Paths**: Fix any import path issues in test files
4. **Coverage Configuration**: Verify pytest-cov configuration works correctly

### Phase 2 Completion Checklist

- [ ] Core API functions implemented and tested
- [ ] External service integrations working
- [ ] Frontend components developed
- [ ] Data simulation tools complete
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline re-enabled and tested
