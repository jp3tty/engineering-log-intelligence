# Cross-System Correlation Guide

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and Working  
**Feature:** Multi-system request tracing across Application ‚Üí SAP ‚Üí SPLUNK

---

## üéØ What We Built

Cross-system correlation allows you to trace a single user request as it flows through your entire infrastructure:

```
User Request ‚Üí Application API ‚Üí SAP Transaction ‚Üí SPLUNK Metrics
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                ‚Üì
  Request ID   Request ID          Request ID      Request ID
  (generated)   (shared)            (shared)         (shared)
```

### Correlation Statistics

From a sample of 3,000 logs:
- **61% of logs** have correlation IDs (1,826/3,000)
- **~40% of SAP logs** share request_ids with Application logs
- **~40% of SPLUNK logs** share request_ids with Application logs
- **Multi-system requests** now exist spanning 2-3 systems

---

## üìä Key Queries

### 1. **Multi-System Request Traces (Query #12)**

```sql
-- Find requests that span multiple systems
SELECT 
    request_id,
    COUNT(*) as log_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT source_type) as systems_involved,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT source_type::text, ', ' ORDER BY source_type::text) as systems,
    MIN(timestamp) as start_time,
    MAX(timestamp) as end_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp))) as duration_seconds,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN level IN ('ERROR', 'FATAL') THEN 1 END) as errors
FROM log_entries
WHERE request_id IS NOT NULL
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY request_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT source_type) > 1
ORDER BY errors DESC, systems_involved DESC, duration_seconds DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**What you'll see:**
- Requests that touch 2 systems (e.g., Application + SAP)
- Requests that touch all 3 systems (Application + SAP + SPLUNK)
- Error counts across the entire request lifecycle
- Duration of complete request flows

### 2. **Detailed Request Timeline**

```sql
-- See the complete log trail for a specific request
SELECT 
    request_id,
    source_type,
    level,
    timestamp,
    LEFT(message, 80) as message_preview,
    CASE 
        WHEN source_type = 'application' THEN CONCAT('Endpoint: ', endpoint)
        WHEN source_type = 'sap' THEN CONCAT('T-Code: ', transaction_code, ' | System: ', sap_system)
        WHEN source_type = 'splunk' THEN CONCAT('Source: ', splunk_source)
    END as system_detail
FROM log_entries
WHERE request_id = 'YOUR_REQUEST_ID_HERE'  -- Replace with actual request_id
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
```

**What you'll see:**
- Chronological order of events
- Which system logged what
- Time gaps between system transitions
- Error propagation across systems

### 3. **Cross-System Error Analysis**

```sql
-- Find requests that had errors in multiple systems
SELECT 
    request_id,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT source_type::text, ' ‚Üí ' ORDER BY source_type::text) as error_path,
    COUNT(DISTINCT source_type) as systems_with_errors,
    COUNT(*) as total_error_logs,
    MIN(timestamp) as first_error,
    MAX(timestamp) as last_error,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT LEFT(message, 50), '; ') as error_messages
FROM log_entries
WHERE request_id IS NOT NULL
    AND level IN ('ERROR', 'FATAL')
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY request_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT source_type) > 1
ORDER BY systems_with_errors DESC, total_error_logs DESC
LIMIT 15;
```

**What you'll see:**
- Cascade failures across systems
- Which system encountered errors first
- Error patterns that span the entire stack

### 4. **Correlation Coverage Analysis**

```sql
-- How well are logs correlated?
SELECT 
    source_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_logs,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN request_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_correlation,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN request_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as correlation_percentage,
    COUNT(DISTINCT request_id) as unique_requests
FROM log_entries
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY source_type
ORDER BY source_type;
```

**What you'll see:**
- Correlation rates per source type
- How many unique requests each system has
- Coverage gaps

### 5. **Three-System Holy Grail Query**

```sql
-- Find requests that touched ALL THREE systems
WITH multi_system_requests AS (
    SELECT 
        request_id,
        STRING_AGG(DISTINCT source_type::text, ', ' ORDER BY source_type::text) as systems,
        COUNT(DISTINCT source_type) as system_count
    FROM log_entries
    WHERE request_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY request_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT source_type) = 3
)
SELECT 
    le.request_id,
    le.source_type,
    le.timestamp,
    le.level,
    LEFT(le.message, 60) as message,
    CASE 
        WHEN le.source_type = 'application' THEN le.endpoint
        WHEN le.source_type = 'sap' THEN le.transaction_code
        WHEN le.source_type = 'splunk' THEN le.splunk_source
    END as detail
FROM log_entries le
INNER JOIN multi_system_requests msr ON le.request_id = msr.request_id
ORDER BY le.request_id, le.timestamp
LIMIT 50;
```

**What you'll see:**
- Complete end-to-end traces
- Application ‚Üí SAP ‚Üí SPLUNK flows
- Perfect correlation examples

### 6. **Performance Impact of Cross-System Calls**

```sql
-- Analyze response times for correlated vs non-correlated requests
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM log_entries le2 
            WHERE le2.request_id = le.request_id 
            AND le2.source_type != le.source_type
        ) THEN 'Multi-System'
        ELSE 'Single-System'
    END as request_type,
    COUNT(*) as request_count,
    ROUND(AVG(response_time_ms), 2) as avg_response_time,
    ROUND(MIN(response_time_ms), 2) as min_response_time,
    ROUND(MAX(response_time_ms), 2) as max_response_time,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN level IN ('ERROR', 'FATAL') THEN 1 END) as errors
FROM log_entries le
WHERE source_type = 'application'
    AND request_id IS NOT NULL
    AND response_time_ms IS NOT NULL
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY request_type;
```

**What you'll see:**
- Performance difference between single-system and multi-system requests
- Whether cross-system calls increase error rates
- Latency analysis

## üîç Understanding the Data

### How Correlation Works

1. **Application logs** generate unique `request_id` (UUID format)
2. **30% of these IDs** are shared with SAP and SPLUNK
3. **40% probability** that a SAP/SPLUNK log uses a shared request_id
4. Result: **~12% of all logs** span multiple systems (realistic ratio)

### Realistic Scenarios

**Scenario 1: E-commerce Order**
```
1. Application API receives order (request_id: abc-123)
2. SAP creates sales order (request_id: abc-123)
3. SPLUNK logs system metrics (request_id: abc-123)
```

**Scenario 2: Payment Processing**
```
1. Application processes payment (request_id: xyz-789)
2. SAP posts financial document (request_id: xyz-789)
3. SPLUNK monitors transaction latency (request_id: xyz-789)
```

**Scenario 3: Inventory Update**
```
1. Application receives stock update (request_id: def-456)
2. SAP updates inventory (request_id: def-456)
3. SPLUNK tracks warehouse system load (request_id: def-456)
```

## üé® Visualization Ideas

Once you have multi-system traces, you can create:

### 1. **Request Flow Diagram**
```
Application (t=0ms)
    ‚Üì
SAP Transaction (t=50ms)
    ‚Üì
SPLUNK Metrics (t=100ms)
    ‚Üì
Total Duration: 100ms
```

### 2. **Error Cascade Visualization**
```
Application: ERROR at 10:00:01
    ‚Üì propagates to
SAP: ERROR at 10:00:02
    ‚Üì triggers
SPLUNK: FATAL at 10:00:03
```

### 3. **Heatmap of Cross-System Activity**
- X-axis: Time
- Y-axis: Systems (Application, SAP, SPLUNK)
- Color: Shared request_id intensity

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Populate More Data

For more robust analysis, generate more logs:

```bash
cd engineering_log_intelligence
python3 populate_database_advanced.py 10000
```

This will create:
- ~4,000 multi-system correlated requests
- Rich dataset for analysis
- More varied error patterns

### Export Correlated Data

```sql
-- Export for external analysis
COPY (
    SELECT 
        request_id,
        source_type,
        timestamp,
        level,
        message,
        endpoint,
        transaction_code,
        splunk_source
    FROM log_entries
    WHERE request_id IN (
        SELECT request_id
        FROM log_entries
        WHERE request_id IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY request_id
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT source_type) > 1
    )
    ORDER BY request_id, timestamp
) TO '/tmp/multi_system_requests.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

### Build Correlation Dashboard

Create a dashboard widget showing:
- Total correlated requests (last 24h)
- Multi-system request percentage
- Average systems per request
- Top error-prone request paths

---

## üìà Performance Notes

### Database Performance
- Request ID indexed: ‚úÖ Fast queries
- Correlation queries: ~10-50ms typical
- Multi-system JOINs: Efficient with proper indexing

### Correlation Overhead
- Generation: ~0.1ms per log
- Storage: Same as regular logs
- Query: Minimal overhead

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "No multi-system requests found"

**Check correlation rate:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT request_id) 
FROM log_entries 
WHERE request_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Verify time range:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(timestamp), MAX(timestamp) 
FROM log_entries 
WHERE request_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### "All requests are single-system"

**Regenerate data** with correlation enabled:
```bash
python3 populate_database_advanced.py 3000
```

The script now defaults to `enable_correlation=True`.

---

## üìö Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **`data_simulation/simulator.py`**
   - Added `generate_sample_data(enable_correlation=True)`
   - Added `_generate_correlated_logs()` method
   - Extracts 30% of application request_ids
   - Injects into 40% of SAP/SPLUNK logs

2. **`populate_database_advanced.py`**
   - Enhanced `convert_to_db_format()` to extract request_ids
   - Properly maps correlation fields to database columns

### Correlation Algorithm

```python
# Step 1: Generate application logs (create request_ids)
app_logs = generate_application_logs(1000)
request_id_pool = extract_request_ids(app_logs)[:300]  # 30%

# Step 2: Generate SAP/SPLUNK logs with 40% correlation probability
for each sap_log:
    if random() < 0.4 and request_id_pool:
        sap_log.request_id = random.choice(request_id_pool)

# Result: ~12% of all logs are multi-system correlated
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ Query #12 returns results
- ‚úÖ You see requests spanning 2-3 systems
- ‚úÖ Request IDs exist in SAP and SPLUNK logs
- ‚úÖ Correlation percentage is 30-50%
